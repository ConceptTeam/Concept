Week 1:
As the Trello Leader, I created the team's Trello Workspace. It includes a General board, which uses a Kanban template to help us visualize the status of our tasks easier, and specialized boards, which are split into the main features of the project and contain lists for each person working on that feature and a general list. These boards serve as personal to-do lists, thus everyone can use their preferred method of task organization. 
I also updated the General board with the information we discussed during this week's lecture.   

Week 2: 
After each meeting I made sure to update the Trello General board. For better communication, we set up a Discord server on which we can meet and discuss things related to the project easily, even during the break. I familiarized myself with QT, Web Assembly and their relation with C++. Also, I did some research on the tasks I need to implement. So far, I have decided to work on implementing a user login based system, as well as a to do list feature.
