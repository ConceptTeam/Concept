# Week 1

This week I worked together with Andreea. Our goal was to figure out the design of our website, we decided how itâ€™s going to look and drew an approximate sketch. We decided on the colors that are going to be used, the location of all functionalities that we are going to implement, and got approval from our teammates. We also decided in which platform are we going to work and tested it out.

# Week 2, 3

We were working together with Maxime and Marta to make the project run on my computer. That was unsuccesful.

#Week 4

I got to use my friends' computer, we downloaded everything on it. Now it works.
I have edited the first column, where I added the header, the first default list with a clickable name, and a button for adding new lists.
