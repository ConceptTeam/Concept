week1:


For the first week, I did research on how I should be able to make the 
text editor. The idea should first to create a terminal text editor and
then from it adapt it to qt-creator.

I also look up for some libraries that could help me doing it. such as ncurses.

week 2:
I advanced in creating the text editor, but i still haven't commited to repo because:

1) to many bugs because i was relying too much on chat gpt to create the text editor

2) I was learning how to use the qt libraries;

From now on, it seem that it will be more fluid since i have learned better how to use qt, especially the <Qapplication>

the idea of creating first a terminal editor was also very bad, because i won't be able to adapt most of it to qt. And ncurses is not so good for gui purposes


week 3:

Finished making a prototype for the text editor, and started working with gui directly. I suggested the idea of maybe substuting the entire
qml for cpp by using a mix of Qwidgets and QmainWindow libraries in cpp. We will try to put this idea in practice for the next week.

Week 4: 
Added some more features in the main page, such as a button to open more than one text editor.


week 5:

worked on the reduction of the qml code, and in integrating some qt libraries functionalities.

Week 6:

Started working on creating a calendar that holds events. This created some issues since the way that the QCalendarWidget works is a little bit weird.
once it does not hold objects.

Added some more features in the main page, such as a button to open more than one text editor.
