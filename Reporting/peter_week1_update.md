Peter - WEEK 1 WORK:

Got more familiar with git
Started defining Note and Folder classes in order to handle data
Checked what functions I need to add and/or implement, and whom I should communicate with in the team (or not) for each task
Filled the Trello boards

WEEK 2:

Downloaded emscriptin, CMake, Xcode
Started coding: Note and folder classes with display functions, classes definitions and member functions 
can be seen in the cpp_note_folder_classes branch

WEEK 3:

Worked with Alexandre on Database:
Following Hung's guidance, we have implemented a BaseModel parent class
we also defined subclasses (Note, Folder, Timer) by inheritance 
with member functions for each which update the related database

WEEK 4:

During lecture, worked with Alex on ways to test our database handling (thanks to Google test in particular)
Downloaded the SQLite_orm library in order to make the code functional
The database handling part is now done
Next objective: check which subteam/task needs additional help, also make sure the backend part is properly integrated to the frontend/UI part, work on a way to have a list of files accessible to open on the ui itself instead of having it in one's computer database during the vacation.


WEEK 5:
During the lecture, understood the updates and the new logic behind our project after the vacation.
During the TD and the week for genereally: worked on the rename and delete features of the app, thanks to Nguyen's advice the new name is updated instantly on the UI. I will need to follow my work on the delete feature during next lecture at least.
Objectives for next week: finish implementing the delete feature, and further on a line highlight feature.
