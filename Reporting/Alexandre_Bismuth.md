Alexandre Bismuth Reporting File

Lead for the development of the Kernel implementation, the Data Organisation, as well as the Search Bar. Part of the development of the Text editor.

# Week 1:

Discussed the project as a group and started doing personal research to evaluate the feasability and the structure of all the features I would be working on.

1. Data Organisaion - Started doing research about handling of Data in C++ to avoid using SQL (https://t.ly/0df-J)
2. Search bar - Started doing reasearch about implementation of search bars in C++. I will divide the work in different steps : Data Indexing, Search Algorithm Implementation, Integration within the UI, Testing.
3. Kernel Implementation - Brainstormed and researched with Octave the feasability and the potential structure of a kernel which would run code inside our app similarly to a Jupyter Notebook. For now, we are still unsure how we could do this without comprimising the UX as opening a local host is inconvenient.
4. Text Editor - Plan to implement a feature which allows the user to have a text box formatted and highlighted as would be a code in VSCode: Command recognition, Box Creation, Syntax highlighting & code formatting databasing, integration and testing within UI.
