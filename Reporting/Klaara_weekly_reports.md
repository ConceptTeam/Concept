Week 1:
We met with the team to discuss our roles. I planned out what kind of features I could be responsible for implementing and started searching for pre-existing simple implementations of these features.
- timer: set focus time, collect data for total duration of focus time, implement pause/quit/continue
- to-do list: add and complete tasks
- focus tracking: set goals for day/week/month, follow progress, collect stats (time, words typed, tasks completed)
- feedback system: gather and display statistics about progression of goals/comparison to previous days/weeks
- trend prediction: draw predicitions for productivity in the future based on exisiting data

Created framework for a class of Timer objects to start the implementation of the timer.

Week 2:
Medically excused absence from classes and coursework.

Week 3:
Defined more functions for the global timer. Researched and used the std::chrono library to simplify how time is tracked and stored by class timer items.

Week 4:
Discussed and redesigned the storing of timer-related data with Alex. Realized in the TD (after discussing with a TA and my team members) that my implementation of the timer was not compatible with our app, and started rewriting it.
