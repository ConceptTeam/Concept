Maxime Despr√©aux Weekly Update


    Week 1: 
        After disscussing in lecture about how we wanted to tackle this project and with what tools, we chose to create a WebApp with Qt's WebAssembly, Emscripten and CMake.
        For now, the structure is very generic as we thought having a basis for everyone to be able to work on at the same time (and not have to wait for certain things to be 
        added until they could implement there part). 




     Week 2: 
        This week, we finished setting up the environment on each local machine so that everyone can get to work. The UI is coming along with a header at the top. For now, it
        isn't functional as we still need to add the functions and classes to link everything. That will be the goal for next week for the already existing UI and main
        functionalities, as well as keep improving the UI. Also just saw a potential issue in builds for windows, linux or macOS, will ask in lecture about version compatibility.
