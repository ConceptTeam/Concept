# Report Andreea Patarlageanu - Week 1
This week, week 1, I worked with my colleague, Milana, and decided what we need, what we have to do and how are we going to work on the UI. We made a sketch about how we want it to look like, the colors, and the theme, we discussed with the teammates how we would implement all the functionalities and did research on how to start with the QT Library (basic examplesâ€¦).

This week, I started the the title bar and finished it. The title bar contain the title "Concept", a button for "Help", a search bar and the button "Search". The color of the title bar is from the color pallette we chose. The buttons don't have any functionalities yet, but the code will be added after my collegues will provide me their code. I added enough space between the buttons so the interface looks more organized and clear. The help button will preovide help to the users who have any difficulties using the web app. The search button can be clicked after the user types in the search bar. The font of the title will be modified later, after I conclude with my colleagues which one is the best for our app.

# Report Andreea Patarlageanu - Week 3
This week, I "repaired" the small mistakes/bugs there were in the QML Code. I made the screen fit for any screen and started the "Pomodoro" column, meaning the timer block with its buttons. Monday, during the lecture, I will finish it. Moreover, I did some research on how to "resize" column using the "drag and resize" functionality,
but together with the team, I concluded on implementing this functionality later, after we implement other functionalities which will determine how are we going to resize the column. The code for the resizing functionality is in Comments, since I started and left it there for later, when we will come back to it.

Started working on the "Set focus Period" button. In C++, I added it's properities in order to make a drop down appear when the user clicks it. The idea behind it is that the user can select for how long he wants to study, thus he clicks on the button, and in the drop down menu, he has multiple options: 25, 30, 45, 60 mins. 
Thus, I had to implement the .h and .cpp files and modify the main.cpp file as well. For now, it does not appear but I am still debugging in order to make it appear.  

# Report Andreea Patarlageanu - Week 5 
This week, while trying to debug my code, QT crashed(because of Windows, of course) and I spent the full week trying to fix the problem on my laptop, For now, the project can not be configured but we installed a virtual machine so soon it should work. Unfortunately, we spent more than 8 hours trying to fix this problem... 
It is an unfortunate situation since it worked perfectly until Monday, and it simply stopped configuring, without any modification. But we are on the right path and soon I will be able to work again.

Finished the drop-down menu for the Set Focus Period Button. Now, the user can choose whether he wants to work for a certain nr of minutes or for one hour. When clicked, there is a print just to make sure it works(and it does!). For the following week, I will start looking forward to implementing the timer.

# Report Andreea Patarlageanu - Week 7
I made some modifications in the UI regarding the alignment of the text and some colors and now I am currently working on implementing a dark/light mode which the user can set while using the web app. The web app is currently on dark mode so I have to set the new colors and the option of the light mode
