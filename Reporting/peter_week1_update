Checked what functions I need to add and/or implement, and whom I should communicate with in the team (or not) for each task
Filled the Trello boards

Worked with Alexandre on Database:
Following Hung's guidance, we have implemented a BaseModel parent class
we also defined subclasses (Note, Folder, Timer) by inheritance
