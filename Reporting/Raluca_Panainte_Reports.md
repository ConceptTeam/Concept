Week 1:
As the Trello Leader, I created the team's Trello Workspace. It includes a General board, which uses a Kanban template to help us visualize the status of our tasks easier, and specialized boards, which are split into the main features of the project and contain lists for each person working on that feature and a general list. These boards serve as personal to-do lists, thus everyone can use their preferred method of task organization. 
I also updated the General board with the information we discussed during this week's lecture.   

Week 2: 
After each meeting I made sure to update the Trello General board. For better communication, we set up a Discord server on which we can meet and discuss things related to the project easily, even during the break. I familiarized myself with QT, Web Assembly and their relation with C++. Also, I did some research on the tasks I need to implement. So far, I have decided to work on implementing a user login based system, as well as a to do list feature. 

Week 3 & Week 4:
Worked on the To Do List Feature of our web app. Coded and tested it locally on my computer. Planning to finally commit to Github my work during week 5.

Week 5: 
Improved the code I had so far for the To Do List feature. 

Week 6 & Week 7 (Vacation):
Struggled with installing Ubuntu on WSL and QT on this. Finally succeeded and continued to improve the To Do List feature. 

Week 8: 
Pushed the To Do List feature on RalucaPanainte/todolist. Currently it is a dynamic list with an add button. Since it is integrated into the old UI, right now I am working on implementing it on the new version of our project. I also want to add a remove feature, letting the user remove the tasks they have completed from the list.
