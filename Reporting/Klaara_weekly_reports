Week 1
We met with the team to discuss our roles. I planned out what kind of features I could be responsible for implementing and started searching for pre-existing simple implementations of these features.
- timer: set focus time, collect data for total duration of focus time, implement pause/quit/continue
- to-do list: add and complete tasks
- focus tracking: set goals for day/week/month, follow progress, collect stats (time, words typed, tasks completed)
- feedback system: gather and display statistics about progression of goals/comparison to previous days/weeks
- trend prediction: draw predicitions for productivity in the future based on exisiting data
